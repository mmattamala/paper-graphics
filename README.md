# Paper Graphics

Resources to help you make scientific figures for your robotics papers.

It mainly stores the assets used in a tutorial I prepared in 2023.

> Matias Mattamala (2023), "Designing Graphics for Scientific Publications". [Online (Google Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J_7wpXovbtMO1EP84cikXDzGpwWb-QxdlihMAiNg3XE/edit?usp=sharing)

The tutorial summarizes the workflow I follow when making figures for my papers and other advice. The goal was on "low budget" solutions, using open-source or other free-to-use software tools instead of expensive professional software.
