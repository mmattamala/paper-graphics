\section{Introduction}
This document shows some examples to get properties of a \LaTeX document, which might be useful to design your graphics.

\section{Double-column Hero Figure}
Making a double-column hero or teaser figure requires a few hacks. In this document we have an example at the top of the front page. The code to generate it is:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
\twocolumn[{%
\renewcommand\twocolumn[1][]{#1}%
\maketitle
% Now we add the hero figure
\begin{center}
    \centering
    \missingfigure{\textbf{Basic sketch.} (...)}
    % Caption
    \captionof{figure}{\textbf{Caption} (...)}
    \label{fig:hero-figure-double}
\end{center}%
}]

\begingroup
    \renewcommand\thefootnote{}\footnote{
    $^{1}$The author is with (...)
    {\tt\small matias@robots.ox.ac.uk}
    }
    \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%
\endgroup
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Please note here that we need to wrap the \texttt{maketitle} command within the block to make it work, so the title, authors, and figure are generated together before we start with the abstract and main text. This also requires to hack the \texttt{thanks} commands sometimes used in the ICRA template, and instead make it 'manually' as the bottom block shows.

\section{Getting the Text and Column Size}
When designing figures, we might want to know the \emph{real} size of the areas available on the paper. For that, we have a few commands to get the numbers directly.

\subsection{Text Size}
The \textbf{text size} corresponds to the full width of the 'writeable' area in the paper, i.e., both columns. To obtain it, in \emph{points}, we can use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
    \the\textwidth
\end{verbatim}
Which will output:
%
\begin{quotation}
\the\textwidth
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Column Size}
The \textbf{column size} is useful when we have double column papers, such as ICRA, IROS, RSS, or TRO. To obtain the size, we can use:
\begin{verbatim}
    \the\columnwidth
\end{verbatim}
which will output:
%
\begin{quotation}
\the\columnwidth
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Line Width}
The \textbf{line width} sets the size of a line of text. This will correspond to different measures depending on the document being single or double column. Similarly:
\begin{verbatim}
    \the\linewidth
\end{verbatim}
will output:
%
\begin{quotation}
    \the\linewidth
\end{quotation}

Just as a reminder, since these numbers are in \emph{points} (pt), you need to convert them to inches by dividing by $72.27$.

\section{Using SI Units}
To ensure that the units are used consistently across your paper, the \texttt{siunitx} package is very useful. It's a bit more verbose than writing the abbreviation yourself but it will guarantee that the format is consistent. For example, the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
\SI{1}{\meter}
\SI{1}{\milli\meter}
\SI{10}{\degree}
\SI{30}{\hertz}
\end{verbatim}
will render:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\SI{1}{\meter}\\
\SI{1}{\milli\meter}\\
\SI{10}{\degree}\\
\SI{30}{\hertz}\\
\end{quotation}

\section{Examples of Figures}
Next I show some examples of figures. I followed the same \emph{style} across them, using the same font and color palette.
I have also added fake text, just to distribute them better across the document and give you a sense on how to control where they are placed.
